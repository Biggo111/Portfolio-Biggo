                    <p>Welcome to my portfolio website! My name is Biggo Bushon Routh, and I am a student of Computer
                        Science and Engineering at Leading University.

                        I specialize in developing mobile applications using Flutter, and I take pride in designing and
                        implementing applications that provide exceptional user experiences. I also have experience
                        working with Machine Learning and Deep Learning technologies, which has helped me gain a deeper
                        understanding of these fields and apply them to real-world projects.

                        I am committed to delivering high-quality results to my clients and take an innovative and
                        creative approach to every project I work on. Whether I am designing a mobile app or creating a
                        machine learning model, I strive to exceed expectations and meet the unique needs of each
                        client.

                        I am always eager to learn and stay up-to-date with the latest advancements in technology. As a
                        result, I am confident in my ability to take on new challenges and provide the best possible
                        solutions to complex problems.<br><br>
